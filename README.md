# RedditBot

#### Project

This RedditBot posts each monring on a chosen subreddit. In the body of the post, a random motivational quote from the .csv file is submitted to help the user start the day.

#### Hosting

The bot is hosted using replit. If not run as a webpage, replit will cease a program after two hours. Therefore, the keep_alive.py file creates an unmanned webpage so that the bot is able to run 24/7. [UptimeRobot](https://uptimerobot.com/) visits the unmanned webpage every five minutes to ensure it stays up.
