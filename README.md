# RedditBot

## Project

RedditBot uses the Python Reddit API Wrapper (PRAW) to interact with Reddit's API. It accesses CSV and JSON files to generate content for post and comment submissions each day. To use this yourself, fill in the PRAW instance with account information you receive from [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/prefs/apps).

## Flask

keep_alive.py creates a web application using Flask, which is visited every five minutes by [UptimeRobot](https://uptimerobot.com/) to keep the web application online and the bot running.
